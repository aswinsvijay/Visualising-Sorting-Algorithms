# Visualising Sorting Algorithms

Sorting algorithms visualised using bar graph with pygame module.

The environment can be tweaked by modifying the `config.py` file.
* `w,h` - width and height of the window
* `fps` - frame rate of the animation, use 0 for interactive mode
* `n` - number of elements in the list to sort.
